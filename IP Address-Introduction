IP address allows one computer to communicate with another via the Internet. It provides a unique identity to billions of digital devices that are connected to the Internet.

 

IP stands for “Internet Protocol“. So, IP Address is an Internet Protocol Address that is used to uniquely identify a device on the network. This is only because of this Address that two-way communication is possible on the network.

 

This address is also known as Logical Address. It is a core component on which the networking architecture is built; no network exists without it.

 

Basically, it is divided into 2 parts:

The network part specifies which networks this address belongs to and
The host part further pinpoints the exact location
 

Why we Need it?
This address provides an identity to a device. Just like we have home or business address supplying that specific physical location with an identifiable address, similarly devices on the network are differentiated from one another through IP Address.

For Example: Whenever we want to place a call, we need Phone number of the other person. In the same way, we need Internet Protocol Address
